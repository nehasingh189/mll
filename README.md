### Local Development

#### Useful Gulp Commands
This project uses gulp as the javascript build utility and task runner.
Run these commands from the src/main/webapp directory.

**gulp build** - builds the code un-minified in the dist directory  
**gulp build --prd** - builds the code minified for deploying to production
**gulp develop** - automatically watches for file changes and rebuilds each time. Useful for making small UI tweaks  
**gulp test** - runs the karma tests. Test configurations (browser, etc.) are specified in karma.conf.js
