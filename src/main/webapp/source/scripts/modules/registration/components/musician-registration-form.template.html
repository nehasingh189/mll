                    <br>&#8195;(a) This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and to their respective successors, assigns and heirs. If a court finds that any provision of this Agreement is void, invalid or unenforceable, but that by limiting such provision it would become valid and enforceable, then such provision shall be deemed to be written, construed and enforced as so limited, and the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as though such void, invalid or unenforceable provision was not a part of this Agreement.
                    <br>
                    <br>&#8195;(b) This Agreement has been entered into in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the validity, interpretation and legal effect of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts applicable to contracts entered into and performed entirely within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The courts of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, only, will have jurisdiction of any controversies regarding this Agreement and any action or other proceeding which involves such a controversy will be brought exclusively in the courts located within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and not elsewhere. The parties hereto hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
                    <br>
                    <br>&#8195;(c) This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding of the parties relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. The waiver by either party of any provision of this Agreement shall not be deemed to waive it for the future.
                    <br>
                    <br>&#8195;(d) Neither party will be deemed to be in breach of any obligations under this Agreement unless written notice stating the specific nature of such breach is provided to the breaching party, and such party fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after such notice was given.
                    <br>
                    <br>&#8195;(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement will constitute a partnership or a joint venture between you and Northeastern. Neither party will hold itself out contrary to the terms of this Section.  Neither party will be liable for any representation, act or omission of the other contrary to the provisions of this Agreement.  This Agreement will not be deemed to give any right or remedy to any third party unless such right or remedy is specifically granted by both parties in writing to such third party.
